"""This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5),
except require the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two list
s of different sizes.

    Randomly generate two lists to test this
"""
import random
list_1=list()

main_list=list()

def max_range(name,range): # to create random list
 while True:

for i in list_3:# removing duplicates from new list
	if i  not in main_list:

print("print this is the  new list which  contain num\n{})  ".format(main_list))
